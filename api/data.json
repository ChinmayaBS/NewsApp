To account for the sampling error created by the LPI’s survey-based dataset, LPI ranks are presented with approximate 80 percent confidence intervals (see appendix 5 of the LPI report available at lpi.worldbank.org). These intervals yield upper and lower bounds for a country’s LPI rank.

        "Long definition": "The Logistics Performance Index overall rank reflects perceptions of a country's logistics performance based on the efficiency of the customs clearance process, quality of trade- and transport-related infrastructure, ease of arranging competitively priced international shipments, quality of logistics services, ability to track and trace consignments, and frequency with which shipments reach the consignee within the scheduled time. The ranks range from 1 to 160 (in the 2018, 2016, and 2014 edition; 155 in 2012 and 2010, and 150 in 2007), with a lower rank representing better performance. Data are from the Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. To account for the sampling error created by the LPI’s survey-based dataset, LPI ranks are presented with approximate 80 percent confidence intervals (see appendix 5 of the LPI report available at lpi.worldbank.org). These intervals yield upper and lower bounds for a country’s LPI rank. Upper bounds for LPI ranks are calculated by increasing a country’s LPI score to its upper bound while maintaining all other country scores constant and then recalculating LPI ranks. An analogous procedure is adopted for lower bounds.",
